Code in VS Code and stop execution by line by line for understanding
Concept of rows and Columns
Explain 2D matrix

Square Star pattern

* * * * * 
Increasing by double

* * * *
* * * * * *
* * * * * * * * 
  
H/W 1:  Increase by triple (multiples of 3)

Star Pattern decreasing

Explain concepts of (- -) decrement operator, >= in condition etc (if <= used which lead to infinite loop)
